# run.py
# The main entry point for training and evaluation loops. Handles argument parsing for different model configurations.
run.py

# ensemble_simple.py
# Implements the weighted ensemble logic. It loads probability distributions from multiple checkpoints and computes the optimal weighted average.
ensemble_simple.py

# filter_hard_data.py
# A utility script used to preprocess the validation set, splitting it into "Easy" (heuristic-solvable) and "Hard" (requires reasoning) subsets for rigorous evaluation.
